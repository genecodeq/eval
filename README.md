# GeneCodeq

GeneCodeq utilises coding theory as a foundation and uses available evidence under a Bayesian statistical model to adjust quality scores in genomic datasets, leading to substantial improvements in compressibility of these datasets.

## Installation

GeneCodeq can be used on 64bit versions of Linux, Mac and Windows. Please consult the wiki pages for more information on setting up GeneCodeq for your system.

## Usage

GeneCodeq uses a command line interface to perform  adjustment of quality scores of sequence reads in fastq/sam file formats. Please consult the wiki pages (Using GeneCodeq) for more details.

## Algorithm

GeneCodeq uses the approach as described in a paper submitted to Bioinformatics to perform adjustment of quality scores. Please consult the paper for more details. The title of the submitted version of the paper is 'GeneCodeq: quality score compression and improved genotyping using coding theory'.

## Repository structure
